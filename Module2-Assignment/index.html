            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative 
            ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, 
            chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, 
            and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
